#Danger Log

- 4.11: Users who have not logged in should not be able to access package index/profile page

- 4.12: The 'logout' and 'profile' buttons should only display for registed users.

- 4.13: The 'user ID' should not be negative numbers.

- 4.13: The 'change address' should only display for non-delivering package

- 4.13: Users cannot change the destination of othersâ€™ packages

- 4.14: When receiving any message, we should check whether the seqnum exists in the arecv or wrecv table. If the seqnum exists,
  	we need to send ack and ignore the message; If the seqnum does not exist, the seqnum should be added to the 'arecv' or 'wrecv' table,
	and the message should be processed.

- 4.14: All the messages sent by UPS should be stored in the 'usend' table, and delete them once corresponding ACK is received

- 4.15: Due to the potential flakiness, need to develop a mechanism that checks unreceived ACK from usend table, and resend those messages

- 4.16: Trucks that have arrived at warehouse and waiting for packages to load must not leave the warehouse until the package is loaded,
  	otherwise serious logistic problem could arise on both UPS and Amazon side

- 4.16: Might run into a situation where all trucks are in loading status, and meanwhile an order comes in and needs to be picked up.
  	In this case, if no truck is available to pick up the order immediately, UPS ignores the order. UPS keep ignoring orders until there
	are trucks available (trucks in status 'delivering' or 'idle' can pick up) again.

- 4.17: Since UPS process messages from Amazon and World in a parallel (multithread) manner, need to add lock for sockets (send, recv), database,
  	and seqnum (seqnum is unique globally, meaning messages sent to Amazon and World are under same seqnum system)

- 4.18: The correct logistic for Amazon and UPS to work together is the following: World comes online first, then Amazon goes online and wait for UPS connection.
  	Finally, UPS goes online and connect to World first to get world id. After getting the world id, UPS connects to Amazon as well as sends out
	the world id to Amazon. In the end, Amazon use the world id to connect to the world.

- 4.19: Amazon might send invalid UPS User ID. When an User ID cannot be found in the database, do not map this package to any account.

- 4.20: Maintain message-ACK communication mechanism between UPS and Amazon even though we are assuming there should not be any packet loss. Not only it is
  	a good practice, but also help out in the case when no truck is available for pickup (mentioned previously).

- 4.21: The check on packet drop (flakiness) should happen fairly frequently, otherwise the whole process can get really slow.

- 4.22: If receive duplicate seqnum, process the first and ignore the later.
